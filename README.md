## A password manager for all no-GUI OSs

I'm creating this password manager for all people that have either a really old pc that has some no gui linux distro on it to make it run or for all those
people that have a no gui installation of raspbian on their Raspberry. 

## Why a new repository?

Because of 3 main reasons:
1. the other code was really written badly (at least for me), it was hard to mantain. 
2. I want to keep the other repo for remembering myself of my progress, and github is the best place to do that. 
3. I still want to leave it public as it could be useful to someone (not very likely but still)
