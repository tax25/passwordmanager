TODOs for the project:

- [x] Checking if a password for a determined website/app is already been saved
- [x] Modify the code to make the user change the name of the app (or website) if it already exists
- [x] Implement a method that just prints everything that is saved in the db just in case the user doesnt remember the pwd name
- [x] Detect Ctrl+c to clean screen when the user force-closes the program
- [x] Fix program creating db in every directory it is called and find a way to make it refer to a single db in a fixed dir
- [x] Make the 'exit' option available everywhere
- [x] Complete the search through date of creation
- [] Find a way to write something when no results are found in search of password (2nd option of main menu) (and even in the 3rd option, since
    if the user types a non existent password, it wont be found and the program probably crashes)
- [] Control if a password exists when in update part, so that the program won't crash when committing the update command
- [] Create documentation for DBManager and TimeManager
