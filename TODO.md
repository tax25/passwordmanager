TODOs for the project:

- [x] Checking if a password for a determined website/app is already been saved
- [x] Modify the code to make the user change the name of the app (or website) if it already exists
- [x] Implement a method that just prints everything that is saved in the db just in case the user doesnt remember the pwd name
- [] Detect Ctrl+c to clean screen when the user force-closes the program
